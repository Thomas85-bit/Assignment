        "Ans: The Diamond Problem is a common issue that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios, particularly in object-oriented programming languages. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, creating a diamond-shaped inheritance structure.\n",

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary features to the user. This allows developers to interact with objects at a high level without needing to understand the intricacies of their internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This concept allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be used in multiple forms, primarily through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: This concept involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Instead of relying solely on inheritance, composition allows for more flexible and modular design, where objects can contain other objects, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns."
